# Global Coffee Trade EDA
Coffee is one of the most consumed products worldwide, being the second most traded product in the world, after oil. The price of coffee fluctuates every year due to the high demand of this product both from countries that consume it domestically as well as from countries that import it due to climatic conditions that do not allow its harvest.

Due to the threats that climate change presents in the production of coffee, the cultivation of this product becomes a process full of uncertainty full of challenges for coffee production. 

This project seeks to make an exploratory analysis of historical data on the world coffee trade, analyzing sectors such as production, exportation, importation, and domestic consumption with the objective of finding patterns in which possible factors can be identified that will help to have a better control in terms of climatic affectations in the cultivation of coffee.
